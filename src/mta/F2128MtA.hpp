/**
   F2128_MTA. This namespace implements two multiplicative-to-additive secret
   sharing schemes. In particular, we implement the unbatched scheme from:

   Secure Two-party Threshold ECDSA from ECDSA Assumptions,
   Jack Doerner and Yashvanth Kondi and Eysa Lee and abhi shelat,
   S&P 2018,

   and the batched scheme from

   Threshold ECDSA from ECDSA Assumptions: The Multiparty Case
   Jack Doerner and Yashvanth Kondi and Eysa Lee and abhi shelat,
   S&P 2019.

   Note that this namespace is deliberately separate from the other MtA code
because the other MtA code is not secure over fields of characteristic 2.

   This particular namespace is restricted to the use of operations
   over GF(2^128): we gain tremendous speedups by based on treating
   operations over GF(2^128) as native operations. This, of course,
   restricts the generality of our implementation somewhat.

   There are some remarks to bear in mind about this namespace. The
   namespace itself deals with emp's OT API directly. Because
   emp OT's API traffics almost exclusively in emp blocks (which are 128 bit
data types) we end up needing to do practically more OTs than the proof
describes. This has the impact of needing expansion around choice bits etc. We
also produce extra pads too, which is important from a randomness perspective.

   Please note that this namespace also contains an as-yet unpublished
optimisation for the unbatched scheme that was kindly shared with us by the
authors of the aforementioned work. All credit of orginality goes to the
original authors. The batched scheme does not contain this optimisation.

   The unbatched scheme can be accessed via the "_repeated" functions, whereas
the batched scheme can be accessed via the "_batched" functions.

   @remarks Please note that most of the batched functions return unique_ptrs to
types, rather than the types themselves. This is because the structs are
   typically large (i.e the largest is around 12MB), which can cause stack
overflows.
  @remarks You can customise if IKNP or Ferret is used by setting the
"use_ferret" bool in this header.
